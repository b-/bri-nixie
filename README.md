# This was a giant waste of time
I'm now committed to it, like a toxic girl. Nix is the one for me.
Nvim is the one for me

Where is my clown mask. I like my dev tooling like I like my women. High maintenance and providing very little in return for it.


## Roadmap

### Nix Related Conversions
- [ ] tmux setup via nix
- [ ] bash setup via nix
- [ ] alacritty setup via nix
- [ ] starship setup via nix
- [ ] Nerdfonts installation 

### Neovim Related
- [ ] ctags setup cross platform -> integrate setup into nvim for tag usage
- [ ] Determine if its worth moving from Ultisnips -> [Luasnips](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)
    * This is likely pointless but it saves scripting from needing to be done in Python
- [ ] Remove org dependent snippets and replace with intelligent lookups
    * e.g. `PapaPal` shouldn't need to be in this repo - make the snippet grab the project name from mix.exs
- [ ] setup DAP 
- [ ] setup cpp tooling

### Moonshots
- [ ] Once ctags is setup, complete TagStack, migrate to new repo
