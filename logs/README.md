# Documentation

Okay so, a little less documentation and a little more reminders for future me. I do a lot of logging about pretty much everything I work on; wouldn't it be nice to have easy access to that logging in a repo? The perfect place to do that for me is in the repo that contains all of my dev device setup. This directory will contain all of that information.
